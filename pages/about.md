About Me

My name is Chisa Ono, and I am currently living in London. I am passionate about empowering people through fashion and leveraging data to drive purchasing decisions. With one year of experience as a Merchandiser and thirteen years in Public Relations and Marketing Communication in Japan, I have developed a deep understanding of Japanese customers' needs and market trends. This background enables me to use data effectively to influence product planning and boost sales revenue.

In response to the need for data-driven decision-making in marketing and merchandising, I completed a Business Data Analytics course. My Capstone project focused on discovering relationships between items purchased together and applying these insights to enhance product development, staff training, and marketing campaigns.

In my personal time, I enjoy exploring the streets of London, capturing its beautiful architecture and vibrant art scenes with my camera.
